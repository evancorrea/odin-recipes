    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cuban chicken is a warm, comforting dish that captures the heart of everyday Cuban cooking. 
        It’s known for its vibrant citrus aroma, gentle garlic heat, and deeply savory flavor that 
        feels both bright and grounding at the same time. The dish is unfussy and homey, meant to 
        be shared, filling the kitchen with familiar smells and bringing balance to the table alongside 
        rice and beans. More than a recipe, it’s a staple that reflects the simplicity, resourcefulness, 
        and bold yet restrained character of Cuban cuisine.</p>
